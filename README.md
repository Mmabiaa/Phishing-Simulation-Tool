This repository contains simple Python methods that perform basic tasks like counting vowels, checking if a word is a palindrome, summing numbers, and reversing strings.

## Methods

### 1. Vowel Count
This method counts the number of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in a string.

#### Example Usage:
- Pass a string to the method to get the count of vowels.

---

### 2. Palindrome Check
This method checks if a string is a palindrome, meaning the word reads the same forwards and backwards.

#### Example Usage:
- Pass a word or phrase to check if it's a palindrome.

---

### 3. Sum of Numbers
This method calculates the sum of a list of numbers.

#### Example Usage:
- Pass a list of numbers to the method, and it will return the total sum.

---

### 4. Reverse String
This method reverses a given string.

#### Example Usage:
- Pass a string, and the method will return the string in reverse order.
